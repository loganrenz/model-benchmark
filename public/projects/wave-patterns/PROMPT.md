# Wave Pattern Generator

Create an animated wave interference pattern visualization. Include:

- Multiple wave sources creating circular ripples
- 3-5 wave sources placed at different positions
- Waves should interfere with each other, creating beautiful patterns
- Use color gradients to show wave amplitude
- Smooth, continuous animation
- Visual-only output (no UI controls needed)
- Self-contained HTML file that can be displayed in an iframe

Use any technology you prefer (Canvas, SVG, WebGL, etc.). Focus on creating mesmerizing, smooth wave animations with clear interference patterns.
