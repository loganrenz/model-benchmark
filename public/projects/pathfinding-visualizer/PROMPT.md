# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

Create a pathfinding algorithm visualization that shows how an algorithm finds the shortest path. Include:

- A grid-based map (at least 30x30 cells)
- Random obstacles/walls placed throughout the grid
- A clear start point (e.g., green) and end point (e.g., red)
- Implement A* or Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm
- Visualize the algorithm's exploration process:
  - Show cells being explored/visited in one color
  - Show the final shortest path in a different color
- Run the pathfinding automatically on load
- Use distinct colors for: walls, start, end, explored cells, and final path
- Visual-only output (no UI controls needed)
- Self-contained HTML file that can be displayed in an iframe

Use any technology you prefer (Canvas, SVG, etc.). Focus on clearly showing how the algorithm explores the space before finding the optimal path.
