# Sorting Algorithm Race

Create a side-by-side comparison visualization of multiple sorting algorithms running simultaneously. Include:

- 3-4 different sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort)
- Visual bars representing array elements (at least 30-50 elements)
- Real-time animation showing comparisons and swaps as they happen
- Different colors for each algorithm's current operation:
  - One color for elements being compared
  - Another color for elements being swapped
  - A third color for sorted/final positions
- All algorithms operate on the same initial dataset so viewers can see efficiency differences
- Run the sorting automatically on load
- Display algorithm names above each visualization
- Visual-only output (no UI controls needed)
- Self-contained HTML file that can be displayed in an iframe

Use any technology you prefer (Canvas, SVG, etc.). Focus on clearly showing how different algorithms approach the same problem and demonstrating their relative performance through visual comparison.
