# Conway's Game of Life

Create an implementation of Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton. Include:

- A grid of cells (at least 50x50)
- Cells can be alive (filled) or dead (empty)
- Implement the classic rules:
  - Any live cell with 2-3 live neighbors survives
  - Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive
  - All other cells die or stay dead
- Start with a random initial pattern
- Animate the simulation continuously at a visible speed (5-10 generations per second)
- Use contrasting colors to clearly show alive vs dead cells
- Visual-only output (no UI controls needed)
- Self-contained HTML file that can be displayed in an iframe

Use any technology you prefer (Canvas, SVG, etc.). Focus on clear visualization and smooth performance.
