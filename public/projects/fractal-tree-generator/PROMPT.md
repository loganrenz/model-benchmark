# Fractal Tree Generator

Create an animated fractal tree that grows and branches recursively. Include:

- Recursive tree generation with configurable depth (4-6 levels)
- Animated growth showing branches extending over time
- Color gradients from trunk to leaves (brown to green)
- Slight wind animation making branches sway naturally
- Branch angles that vary randomly for organic appearance
- Visual-only output (no UI controls needed)
- Self-contained HTML file that can be displayed in an iframe

Use any technology you prefer (Canvas, SVG, etc.). Focus on creating smooth, organic animations that demonstrate recursive algorithms and natural tree growth patterns.
