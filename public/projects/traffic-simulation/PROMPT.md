# Traffic Simulation Project

Create a traffic light simulation visualization showing cars traveling down a one-way street. Include:

- Multiple cars moving along the road
- A traffic light that alternates between red and green
- Cars must stop at red lights and proceed on green
- Timing should be fast enough to see the system in action (3-5 second cycles)
- Visual-only output (no UI controls needed)
- Self-contained HTML file that can be displayed in an iframe

Use any technology you prefer (Canvas, SVG, Three.js, etc.). Focus on clarity and smooth animation.
