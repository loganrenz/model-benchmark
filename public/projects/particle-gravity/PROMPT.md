# Particle Gravity Simulation

Create a particle physics simulation showing particles affected by gravity and bouncing off surfaces. Include:

- 20-30 particles that spawn with random positions and velocities
- Particles fall due to gravity
- Particles bounce realistically off the bottom and side walls
- Each particle should have a different color
- Add slight dampening so particles gradually lose energy
- Visual-only output (no UI controls needed)
- Self-contained HTML file that can be displayed in an iframe

Use any technology you prefer (Canvas, SVG, etc.). Focus on smooth physics and appealing visuals.
